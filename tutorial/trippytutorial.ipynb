    "Introduction: SExtractor and emcee\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform photometry and source subtraction, in addition to having a good PSF (which trippy will generate) one needs three very important parameters: x, y, and m, or source position and amplitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "When one has the PSF and TSF already generated, one can run a fitting routine to solve for these. For this purpose, we use [emcee.](https://github.com/dfm/emcee) *emcee* is an MCMC routine which allows for good estimates of (x,y,m) and their uncertainties. We use a likelihood definition as the natural log likelihood of the exponential flux, basically exactly what you'd expect. If you are uncertain of what this means, or care for more detail, please go read the *emcee* documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the PSF or TSF is not yet known, to get a centroid (x,y), we need to use some other software. We haven't included this inside trippy because there is no point in reinventing a wheel that has already been nearly perfected. For this purpose, we use the venerable [SExtractor.](http://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor) All jokes on its name aside, *sextractor* does exactly what we need, as well as we would ever need it to be done. \n",
    "\n",
    "Trippy includes a module *trippy.scamp* with functions defined in *scamp.py* and *makeParFiles.py* that mearly provide convenient wrappers to call *sextractor*. This has been done in a couple other packages, but not in a way that satisfies me. Hence my own implementation. A couple details to note: makeParFiles creates all the parameter files in the working directory (eg. *makeParFiles.writeConv()*), and scamp is responsible for *sextractor* execution and catalog reading (*scamp.runSex()* and *scamp.getCatalog*). Catalogs are stored in FITS_LDAC format. This choice was done to facilitate execution of the *sextractor* sister program *scamp*, though we won't need to know what that means for full use of trippy. If you are unfamiliar with *sextractor* and its use, don't adopt trippy as a blackbox. [RTFM!](http://www.starlink.rl.ac.uk/docs/sun226.htx/mud165.pdf)\n",

    "The first thing to do is import all the necessary packages. Note that this notebook assumes you have the optional packages installed, as well as SExtractor available on your command line.\n",
